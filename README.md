Program uses a for loop to compute the future investment value for a dollar amount over a 15 year period

How it Works:

User inputs initial investment (at least $1000) and the expected annual rate of return between 1 - 10%. Program assumes that the user plans to make an annual $500 deposit to this account at the beginning of each year, starting at Year 1

Program prints user's initial investment amount, the annual rate of return and teh annual deposit amount. For each year of the investment period the program prints the year and the investment value at the end of the year. Program assumes that the annual return is compounded annually.
